# CI/CD
Gitlab

Test -> Build -> Deploy

Alt: Dev -> Staging -> Prod

# Docker

# Kubernetes

# Ansible

# Terraform


## Some other notes

Shell Commands
```
# View User, Group, Others permission
ls -l
# Process Status
ps

echo "string" > file
echo "$( < file)"
```

Stateless app: any state would NOT change the data returned. Par excellence for web app
